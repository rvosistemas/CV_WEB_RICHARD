    <h2>Hi, my name is <span>Richard Vivas Ordo√±ez</span></h2>
    <h3>I am a Software Developer</h3>
    <p>I have been working in the world of web development for more than 3 years as a backend mostly in python, although
        I have knowledge in java, php and javascript (also starting in the fronted world). I have worked with startups
        such as Knowark, LQN, Mensajeros Urbanos, creating solutions and supporting their technological products and
        services. For this reason I make available my knowledge, skills, discipline and my desire to continue learning
        to achieve great goals together.</p>
