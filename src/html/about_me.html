    <p data-section="about_me" data-value="description">I have been working in the world of web development for more
        than 3 years as a backend mostly in python, although I have knowledge in java, php and javascript (also starting
        in the fronted world). I have worked with startups such as Knowark, LQN, Mensajeros Urbanos, creating solutions
        and supporting their technological products and services. For this reason I make available my knowledge, skills,
        discipline and my desire to continue learning to achieve great goals together.</p>
